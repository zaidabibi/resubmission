                <div class="camping-content">is an activity that means something different to everyone,it is decribed as an outdoor recreational activity. The participants leave urban areas,
              their home region, or civilisation and enjoy nature while spending one or several nights
              outdoors, usually at a campsite. Camping may involve the use of a tent, caravan,
              motorhome, a primitive structure, or no shelter at all.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping">Read more...</a>

                     Hiking is the preferred term, in Canada and the United States, for a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails (footpaths), in the countryside, while the word walking is used for shorter, particularly urban walks. On the other hand, in the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, the word "walking" is acceptable to describe all forms of walking, whether it is a walk in the park or backpacking in the Alps.   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking">Read more...</a>

                 <h2>Camping</h2> <p>Sometimes camping and its associated activities present you with challenges (and some that not even Professor Google can reliably solve). Often these are challenges that you don’t deal with on a daily basis: where and how to set up your tent; or how to deal with scenarios where you aren’t armed with all your mod-cons or items of familiarity.</p>
                   <p>In addition, camping introduces you to new experiences – perhaps an activity you’d always wanted to try but never found time for. Whatever the case, new challenges and experiences keep your brain healthy, as they force you to think for yourself.</p>
                     <p>Following the above point, spending the night in a tent has a clear benefit for children. This is especially so in the modern age where many kids are more confident navigating their way around an iPad than they are navigating the inside of a tent.</p>

                        <p>Camping introduces children to a whole new world and asks of them an ability to overcome new problems and challenges – particularly if it’s raining while camping. Having exposure to a different set of challenges not only keeps kids’ brains healthy but leads to increased learning opportunities. A 2015 UK study from the Institute of Education at Plymouth University found an overwhelming majority of parents believed that camping had a positive impact on a child's education.</p>

                               <h2>Hiking</h2><p> means taking a long walk in the countryside, usually for pleasure or for exercise. In other words, hiking can be defined simply as walking for recreational purposes. In hiking, the journey is more important than the destination. Hiking could be your average Sunday walk through the park or it could be a week-long expedition through the mountains of Helderberg</p>
                                  <p>The term ‘hiking’ is used for long energetic walks, usually on trails in the countryside, while the word walking is used for shorter particularly urban walks</p>
                                     <p>The idea of undertaking a walk through the countryside for pleasure developed in the 18th century, and arose because of changing attitudes to landscape and nature, associated with the Romantic Movement (artistic, literary and intellectual movement). Thomas West, an English clergyman, popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the Lake District of 1778</p>

                                      <h2>Fishing</h2> <p> Recreational fishing (RF) is defined as the “fishing of aquatic animals (mainly fish) that doesn’t constitute the individual’s primary resource to meet basic nutrition needs and are not generally sold or otherwise traded .</p>
                                         <p>Angling can be defined as line fishing using the hooking method. As angling can be both commercial and non-commercial, recreational angling can be defined as the activity of catching or attempting to catch fish, principally by rod and line, pole or hand-held line for non-commercial purposes</p>

                                         <h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
                                              <p>It’s believed that the sport of rock climbing really got going in Germany, England, and Italy before it spread to the US and rest of the world.

                                                 In the US, Yosemite became a popular place for people to go and practice their climbing. It became a way of life, and with this revolution came the need for better equipment.

                                                  The 1960s brought about a time when gear was really revolutionized to work for climbers. Before today’s equipment, people used Manila hemp rope instead of dynamic rope, squares of carpet instead of crash pads, and nail-spiked boots instead of climbing shoes. Basic carabiners came about in 1910 and it wasn’t until 1991 that the first wiregate carabiner was created.</p>
